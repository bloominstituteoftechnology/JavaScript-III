# JavaScript - III

This challenge focuses on using the `this` keyword as well as getting comfortable with prototypes by building out a fantasy themed video game.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

- [x] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [x] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
- [x] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [x] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [x] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

- [x] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [x] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [x] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

## Assignment Set Up

- Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
- To test your `console.log()` statements, open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.

## The `this` keyword

Having a solid understanding of how `this` works will give you a huge advantage when you start building with more advanced frameworks. Use the [this.js](assignments/this.js) file to traverse through a few `this` problems.

## Prototype

The prototype challenge will focus on building prototypes for a fantasy themed game that includes mages, swordsmen, and archers. Follow the [prototypes.js](assignments/this.js) instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an awesome JavaScript game.

- Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges.
- Remember to un-comment the objects and console logs to test your work at the bottom of the page.
