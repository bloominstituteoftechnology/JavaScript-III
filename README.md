# JavaScript - III
This challenge focuses on using the `this` keyword as well as getting comfortable with prototypes by building out a fantasy themed video game.   

## Assignment Description

* Fork/Clone this repository.
* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
* Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
* To test your `console` statements you can run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal. You can also use an online tool like `JSBin`, `REPL.it`, `JSFiddle`, or even your `Chrome developer console`.
* Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.

### The `this` keyword
Having a solid understanding of how `this` works will give you a huge advantage when you start building with more advanced frameworks. Use the [this.js](assignments/this.js) file to traverse through a few `this` problems.

### Prototype
The prototype challenge will focus on building prototypes for a fantasy themed game that includes mages, swordsmen, and archers.  Follow the [prototypes.js](assignments/this.js) instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an awesome JavaScript game.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges.
* Remember to uncomment the objects and console logs to test your work at the bottom of the page.
