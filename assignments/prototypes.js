/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance heirarchy.

  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  

  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properites and methods that are defined in their block comments below:

  * destroy() // prototype method -> returns the string: 'Object was removed from the game.'

  // Stretch task: 
  // * Create Villian and Hero constructor functions that inherit from the Humanoid constructor function.  
  // * Give the Hero and Villians different methods that could be used to remove health points from objects which could result in destruction if health gets to 0 or drops below 0;
  // * Create two new objects, one a villian and one a hero and fight it out with methods!
