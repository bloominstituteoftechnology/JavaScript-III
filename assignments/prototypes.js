/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment
  you will be implementing several classes with their correct inheritance heirarchy.

  In this file you will be creating three classes: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.  
  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all inherit from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your classes.
  
  Each class has unique properites and methods that are defined in their block comments below:

/*
  === GameObject ===
  * createdAt
  * dimensions
  * destroy() // prototype method -> returns the string 'Object was removed from the game.'
*/

};

/*
  === CharacterStats ===
  * hp
  * name
  * takeDamage() // prototype method -> returns the string '<object name> took damage.'
  * should inherit destroy() from GameObject's prototype

  // Stretch task: 
  // * Create Villian and Hero classes that inherit from the Humanoid class.  
  // * Give the Hero and Villians different methods that could be used to remove health points from objects which could result in destruction if health gets to 0 or drops below 0;
  // * Create two new objects, one a villian and one a hero and fight it out with methods!
