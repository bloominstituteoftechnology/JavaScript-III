*/
* 1. Window or Global Object Binding
	In the JavaScript programming language, 'scope' referes to the  context of a variable. The global or windows scope is the most universal context of code - simply meaning that all variables declared in this scope are accessible to more localized (or private) scopes. With this understanding, Global Object Binding can be said to be a type of replication that creates a new function within the global/univesal context.
* 2. Implicit Binding
	- when a function is called using dot notation, the
* 3. New Binding
	- when a new variable
* 4. Explicit Binding
