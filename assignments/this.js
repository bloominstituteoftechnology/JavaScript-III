/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding: In the global scope, the "this" keyword references the window/console object.
* 2. Implicit Binding: The "this" keyword references the object to the left of the dot.
* 3. Explicit Binding: The "this" keyword is explicitly defined when using the .call, .apply, or .bind methods.
* 4. New Binding: When using a constructor function, the "this" keyword will reference the newly created object.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
