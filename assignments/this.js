/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. In a simple function call, this will default to the global object, and be undefined under strict mode.
* 2. Implicit binding, it points to the object of which the function is called.
* 3. This can also be explicit, in that you can point to a certain value using call, apply or bind.
* 4. This can point to a newly constructed object using the "new" keyword.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
