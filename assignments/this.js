/* The four principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. when 'this' is in global scope, it refrences the window or console object.
* 2. implicit binding: when object.function is called, 'this' (in the function) refers to the the object preceding the dot.
* 3. new binding: when the 'new' keyword is used to create an instance of an object, 'this' in the constructor funtion refers to that 
    object instance.
* 4. explicit binding: the 'call' and 'apply' methods explicitly state which object 'this' refers to.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
