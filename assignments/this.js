/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Implicit-"What is left to the dot". Implict binding happens while using dot notation to invoke a
function. Whatever is left of the dot is becomes the context for the "this" keyword
* 2. Explicit- Occurs when using .call(), .apply(); or .bind(). When you use these methods you are
specifically using the 'this' keyword isnide of the method.
* 3. New- when using new, javascript will create a new object where the 'this' keyword is bound to the new object
being made.
* 4. Window/global- when this keyword isn't specified to a function its considered to be global/or on the window.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
