/* The for* principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
*                      *: four
* 1. Global binding: The value of 'this' refers to the overall global object- in the browser, this would be the Window object.
* 2. Implicit binding: The value of 'this' is "bound" to the object calling it- the property "name" is bound to the object. The value of the name property is like a pointer- that is to say, "this one, this is what 'this' refers to."
* 3.  New binding: The value os 'this' is refers directly to the object that is created and returned by the constructor function. It will have access to the __prototype__ "DNA", that is to say: each instantiation of an object will have access to the same properties which are relative to a unique "this".
* 4. Explicit binding: The constuctor function's "DNA" or prototype can be overridden or just re-worked with the use of explicit binding. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
