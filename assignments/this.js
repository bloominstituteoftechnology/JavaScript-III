/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. If we are not using dot notation or using call(), apply(), or bind(), "this" will be the global object, which when working in a browser is the window. 
* 2. Implicit binding happens when we use dot notation to invoke a function.
* 3. New creates a new object and makes the "this" variable point to the new object.
* 4. Explicit binding happens when .call(), .apply(), or .bind() are used on a function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
