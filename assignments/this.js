/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/global binding -- when using "this" in the global scope, the value will be the window object
* 2. Implicit binding -- when "this" is bound within a local scope, the value is equal to the object before the dot (when calling the function)
* 3. New binding -- when a constructor function is used to create an object, the value of "this" is applied to the specific instance of the object that is created
* 4. Explicit binding -- when you control the value of "this" by using a call or apply method
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
