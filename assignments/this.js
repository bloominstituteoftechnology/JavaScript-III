/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - when you're in global scope, the window/console object is the value of this
* 2. Implicit Binding - this will point to the object before the dot that precedes a function that is called 
* 3. New Binding - this will refer the object that is created and returned by the constructor function
* 4. Explicit Binding - when using .call or .apply, you're explicitly defining this.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
