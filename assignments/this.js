/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window-binding: This applies to the global scope. If nothing is bound to the "this" keyword, it will go to the window.
* 2. Implicit-binding: Whatever is directly left of the invocation is the "this" keyword context.
* 3. Explicit-binding: This uses .call, .bind, or .apply to reference to a function where the "this" keyword is referenced to.
* 4. new-binding: When you create a function and then an object referring back to that function "new," "this" refers to the new object.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
