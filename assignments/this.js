/* The for principles of "this";
 * in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
 *
 * 1. Window Binding
 *    The window binding is when you (often times accidentally) direct the "this" keyword to refer to the Window object. For instance,
 *    if you were to write a function in the global scope that did not "use strict" and that had a console.log(this), the "this" would
 *    refer to the window object. You typically don't want this to happen.
 *
 * 2. Implicit Binding
 *    Implicit binding is when you

 * 3. Explicit Binding
 * 4. New Binding
 *
 * write out a code example of each explanation above
