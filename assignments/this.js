/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. If this is used in the global scope, it refers to the window of that scope.
* 2. Using dot notation, this can be encapsulated within the next scope.
* 3. If you use this in a class's constructor method, it will refer to the instantiated object
* 4. obj.call(), obj.apply() and obj.bind() are prototypes for classes for allowing this to be explicitely defined where it points to
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
