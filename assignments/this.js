/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding: If this is declared on a global scope it is bound to the window it is being run in.
* 2. Implicit Binding: If this is used to envoke a function with dot notation it is inplicitly bound.
* 3. New Binding: When the operator New is used to create a new instance from a constructor function the this keyword is bound to the function.  
* 4. Explicit Binding: When .call(), .apply() or .bind() are used on a function this is explicitly bound to that function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
