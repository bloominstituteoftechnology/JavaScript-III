* 1. Window Binding: Strict mode. Results often undefined to prevent code break.

* 2. Implicit Binding: Auto, common. Function takes value left of 'this' in method objects.

* 3. New Binding: Uses 'new' to create an object 'this' refers to.

* 4. Explicit Binding: Uses 'call', 'apply'and 'bind' to refer directly to values.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
