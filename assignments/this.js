// Principle 1

// code example for Window Binding

function sayYourName(name) {
   console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
}


// Principle 2

// code example for Implicit Binding

const student = {
	"name": "Sam",
	"age": 25,
	"studentInfo": function() {
		return `Student's name is ${this.name} and student's age is ${this.age}`;
	} 
}


// Principle 3

// code example for New Binding

function NiceNeighbor(neighbor) {
  this.sentence = "Welcome to the neighborhood!";
  this.neighbor = neighbor;
  this.speak = function() {
    console.log( `${this.neighbor} says  ${this.sentence}`);
  }
}

const sam = new NiceNeighbor("Sam");

sam.speak();


// Principle 4

// code example for Explicit Binding

const car = {
	"make": "subaru",
	"price": 5000
}

const colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
