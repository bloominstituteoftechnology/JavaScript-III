/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Implicit Binding - context is implied as the object to the left of the dot
* 2. Explicit Binding - context is referenced using functions/methods such as call, apply, bind
* 3. New Binding - context is the object being instantiated
* 4. Window/Global Object Binding - context not clearly defined (defaults to window object)
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
