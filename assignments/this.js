/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding allows if no other binding is attached, the window is what is used for 'this'.
* 2. Implicit binding occurs when dot notation is used to invoke a function.
* 3. New binding creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.
* 4. Explicit binding of this occurs when .call(), .apply(), or .bind() are used on a function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
