/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window or Global binding. This means if used on the global scope (not inside a function or method) then it will be pointed at the Global scope.
* 2. Implicit binding. When you call a function using a dot, then the this applies to the function mentioned on the left side of that dot. That's the function we'll be using.
* 3. Explicit binding.  When you call a function and use .call, .apply, or bind. You "explicitly" tell "this" to use the function mentioned in the argument.
* 4. New Biding. When a constructor function is used. "This" is used in the object to refer to a specific item and then you can return that in the constructor function.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
