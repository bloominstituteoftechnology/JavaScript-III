/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - Window binding uses this in the loosest. It is used to describe the window that it is in. In this case it is the web browser object.
* 2. Implicit - Implicit binding is an implied or automatic when there is only one possiblity and it is obvious in context it is an implict instance.
* 3. Explicit - Explicit binding is a more specific instance of :this: because it is not automatic it must be further specified what :this: is refering to.
* 4. Prototyple - Prototyple programming is defiently the most complex of the principles. When using a prototyple instance of :this: involves constructor functions and passing :this: from one object to another using methods and/or functions.

* write out a code example of each explanation above
